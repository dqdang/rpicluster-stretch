-create python code that stamps user images on download
   fdisk -l Server.img (the unzipped file, this command gives you partition start)
   sudo disktype Server.img (this command gives you the fs type)
   sudo mount Server.img mount/ -t ext4 -o loop -o offset=50463744
   (this command should mount at offset)

-create code that checks for boot file that has been stamped and updates access point name and password accordingly

-normalize permissions of files

-update status tool, network manager, and help to include OTG MODE

-set up a NFS cloud so the master and nodes can share files easily http://mpitutorial.com/tutorials/running-an-mpi-cluster-within-a-lan/

-update about section on website

-take photos for website

-ALEC: make it so the node config happens instantly on machine boot not .profile, this way before initial network config reboot we can say hey its gonna reboot twice just give it some time. 


NETWORK MANAGER:

-need to create enable and disable scripts for all 3 modes
1)wifi : DONE
2)switch : DONE
3)otg : NOT DONE

-for OTG: 
1) dns to allow for a connection without a unique mac address on otg
2) make connection, then run ip_configuration-like program to give the currently connected non-configured pi a unique ip address and otg mac address
